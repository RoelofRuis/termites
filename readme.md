## Termites

Termites is a reactive/dataflow framework. It aims to ease code inspection by allowing messages to be passed between different components.

### Modules

`termites-core` contains code for creating processing graphs.

`termites-debug` contains a powerful web debugger that can be hooked into a graph for inspection (and is itself a graph as well..!).
